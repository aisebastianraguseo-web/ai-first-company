    description: >
      feed-card__relevance--high uses color #f59e0b (amber) on background
      #1a1d27 (card). Computed contrast ratio is approximately 5.7:1 — passes
      AA for normal text. However feed-card__relevance uses font-size 0.75rem
      (12px) with font-weight 700. At 12px bold text is considered 'small' text
      (threshold is 18.67px bold or 24px normal), so the 4.5:1 requirement
      applies and this specific value passes. HOWEVER: .feed-card__meta uses
      font-size 0.8125rem (13px) with color var(--color-text-muted) = #8b8fa8
      on background #1a1d27. Measured contrast: #8b8fa8 on #1a1d27 ≈ 3.1:1.
      This fails WCAG 1.4.3 AA (4.5:1 required for small text). All 'muted'
      text in feed-card__meta (source label, time) is rendered in this color
      at 13px — a systematic failure affecting every feed card visible to
      all users including Petra (TTS context) who relies on visual fallback
      when TTS is unavailable.
    auto_fixable: true
    fix_suggestion: >
      Increase --color-text-muted from #8b8fa8 to at least #9da2bb on
      background #1a1d27 to achieve ≥4.5:1 contrast. Alternatively use
      --color-text (#e2e4f0) for the meta line and reduce visual weight
      via font-size or font-weight only — not color. Run automated contrast
      check (e.g. axe-core) after change.

      0.75rem (12px) bold on #1a1d27. Contrast ≈ 3.1:1, fails 4.5:1 AA
      requirement. The LOW relevance indicator is the least prominent by
      design intent, but must still meet minimum contrast. For Andrea
      (Rot-Grün-Blindheit), the already reduced visual differentiation of
      the LOW badge makes legibility critical.
    auto_fixable: true
    fix_suggestion: >
      Set .feed-card__relevance--low color to #a0a3b8 or similar, targeting
      ≥4.5:1 on #1a1d27. Consider using the same lighter muted tone globally.

    auto_fixable: true

      Same root fix as A11Y-001: raise --color-text-muted globally or apply
      a higher-contrast override specifically for tile descriptive text.

      #0f1117 (body background, since problem-list sits inside dashboard-content).
      Contrast of #8b8fa8 on #0f1117 ≈ 2.8:1, well below 4.5:1 AA threshold.
      problem-card__desc also uses this muted color at 0.9rem on #1a1d27,
      contrast ≈ 3.1:1. Both fail for normal (non-bold, <18px) text.
    auto_fixable: true
    fix_suggestion: >
      Apply the same --color-text-muted correction as A11Y-001. This is a
      systemic token issue: fixing the token value resolves all four contrast
      violations (A11Y-001 through A11Y-004) in one change.

    file: "products/ki-radar/app/components/problems/ProblemForm.tsx"
    line: 67
    description: >
      The modal overlay (role="dialog" aria-modal="true") does not implement
      focus trapping. When ProblemForm opens, keyboard focus is not moved into
      the modal and Tab key can reach elements behind the overlay. WCAG 2.1.1
      requires all functionality to be operable via keyboard. Without a focus
      trap, keyboard users (and screen reader users relying on virtual cursor)
      can interact with obscured background content. Petra (TTS user) would
      experience confusing navigation order when the modal is open.
    auto_fixable: false
    fix_suggestion: >
      Implement focus trap on modal open: (1) Move focus to the modal container
      or first focusable element (h2#problem-form-title or first input) on mount
      using useEffect + ref.focus(). (2) Intercept Tab/Shift+Tab to cycle only
      within the modal. (3) Close modal and return focus to the trigger button
      on Escape. Use a library such as @radix-ui/react-dialog or focus-trap-react,
      or implement manually with a ref to the triggering button saved before open.

    description: >
      The detail panel aside (tabIndex={-1}) becomes visible when a tile is
      clicked but focus is not programmatically moved to it. Keyboard users who
      activate a CapabilityTile with Enter/Space will not have focus moved to
      the newly revealed detail panel. They must Tab through all remaining tiles
      to reach it. This breaks logical focus order (WCAG 2.4.3) and is
      disorienting for Petra using TTS.
    auto_fixable: false
    fix_suggestion: >
      After setSelected(slug), use a useEffect + useRef to call
      detailRef.current?.focus() when selectedTag becomes non-null. The aside
      already has tabIndex={-1} which is the correct prerequisite — focus
      movement just needs to be triggered. Also announce the panel opening via
      the existing live-region (#live-region) in RootLayout.

    file: "products/ki-radar/app/components/feed/FeedCard.tsx"
    line: 88
    description: >
      The external link "Original lesen →" uses aria-describedby={undefined}
      (explicitly set to undefined). While the screen-reader text inside
      <span class="sr-only"> does convey the target title and new-tab warning,
      aria-describedby={undefined} is a no-op and the intent appears to be
      to associate the sr-only span as a description. The description
      relationship is conveyed implicitly by DOM order, not explicitly. This
      is fragile: some AT implementations may not read adjacent hidden spans
      unless explicitly associated. Additionally, each card's link reads
      "Original lesen" — identical accessible names across multiple cards
      violate 2.4.6 (Headings and Labels) and reduce navigability for Petra
      scanning links via TTS link list.
    auto_fixable: true
    fix_suggestion: >
      Replace aria-describedby={undefined} with a generated ID referencing
      the sr-only span, e.g. aria-describedby="feed-link-desc-{item.id}" and
      id="feed-link-desc-{item.id}" on the span. This makes the association
      explicit. The sr-only span content already includes the item title, so
      this also resolves the duplicate link name issue for TTS link list
      navigation.

    line: 248
    description: >
      .input:focus removes the browser default outline (outline: none) and
      replaces it with a box-shadow only. While box-shadow provides a visual
      cue, it is not rendered by Windows High Contrast Mode or certain
      forced-color media queries, leaving input fields with no visible focus
      indicator for keyboard users in those contexts. WCAG 2.4.11 (Focus
      Appearance, AA in 2.2) is not yet required but 2.1.1 is impacted when
      focus state is invisible in assistive contexts.
    auto_fixable: true
    fix_suggestion: >
      Retain the box-shadow for aesthetic purposes but add an explicit
      outline alongside it:
        .input:focus { border-color: var(--color-primary); outline: 2px solid var(--color-primary); outline-offset: 0; box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px rgba(99,102,241,0.3); }
      This ensures visibility in High Contrast Mode while preserving the
      design intent. The global :focus-visible rule in the CSS correctly
      uses outline — inputs must not override it to none.

    line: 18
    description: >
      The dashboard layout wraps all content in <main id="main-content"> from
      RootLayout, which is correct. However, the sidebar navigation renders
      before dashboard content in DOM order, and there is no skip link to bypass
      it from within the dashboard pages. The root skip-link targets #main-content
      which maps to the outer <main> wrapper in RootLayout — this correctly skips
      the Clerk provider boilerplate but does NOT skip the sidebar navigation
      inside the dashboard layout. Once inside the dashboard, Tab from the
      address bar hits the skip link, then lands in the sidebar nav (3 links +
      UserButton) before reaching page content. For Petra using TTS, this
      means traversing the full sidebar on every page navigation.
    auto_fixable: true
    fix_suggestion: >
      Add a second skip link inside DashboardLayout that targets the main
      content area of the dashboard:
        <a href="#dashboard-content" className="skip-link">Zur Seiteninhalt springen</a>
      And add id="dashboard-content" to the .dashboard-content div. This
      provides WCAG 2.4.1-compliant bypass for keyboard users after they
      have entered the dashboard shell.

    line: 90
    description: >
      The title input uses aria-describedby={error ? 'pf-error' : undefined}.
      This correctly associates the error message when present. However, the
      error element (#pf-error) is conditionally rendered — it does not exist
      in the DOM when there is no error. When the aria-describedby reference
      resolves to a non-existent element, some AT (notably NVDA + Chrome) may
      emit a warning or silently fail. This is a minor robustness issue rather
      than a hard failure. Also: when description textarea has a server-side
      validation error (HTTP 422), the error is displayed but aria-describedby
      is only on the title input — other fields do not get the association even
      if the error message concerns them.
    auto_fixable: true
    fix_suggestion: >
      Always render the error container in the DOM but conditionally show it:
        <p id="pf-error" role="alert" aria-live="assertive" className="form-error"
           style={{ display: error ? 'block' : 'none' }}>
          {error}
        </p>
      This keeps the IDREF permanently valid. For field-specific 422 errors,
      consider adding aria-describedby="pf-error" to all form fields, or
      parsing the error response to identify the offending field.

      capability-tile__desc renders description_plain as visible text inside
      the button. This text is also used in the button's title attribute
      (accessible via tooltip on hover). The aria-label on the button already
      provides name + count + status. However, the description text inside the
      button is NOT hidden with aria-hidden, so screen readers will announce
      the aria-label AND then read the visible description text again, resulting
      in duplicate/verbose announcements for Petra. The visible description is
      redundant given the complete aria-label already present.
    auto_fixable: true
    fix_suggestion: >
      Add aria-hidden="true" to the .capability-tile__desc span:
        <span className="capability-tile__desc" aria-hidden="true">{description_plain}</span>
      The aria-label on the button already conveys the semantic meaning; the
      description is supplementary visual context only. Alternatively, remove
      the explicit aria-label from the button and rely on concatenated button
      content — but the current aria-label is more controlled and preferred.

      Navigation items use emoji characters (📡, 🗺️, 🎯) that are wrapped in
      aria-hidden="true" spans — this is correct and intentional. However,
      the emoji in the sidebar brand ("📡 KI-Radar") is also aria-hidden. This
      is correctly handled. No violation here — noting as LOW because emoji
      rendering in older AT can still produce inconsistent announcements, and
      the brand icon emoji does not add semantic value. Confirmed: no WCAG
      violation, but flagged for AT compatibility awareness.
    auto_fixable: false
    fix_suggestion: >
      No code change required. Consider adding a comment that emoji are
      intentionally aria-hidden per a11y audit A11Y-012 to prevent future
      removal of aria-hidden during refactoring.

      On mobile viewports (max-width: 768px), the sidebar is set to
      display:none with a comment "Mobile: bottom nav in V2". This means
      mobile users currently have NO navigation at all — no bottom nav exists
      yet. While this is a known V2 gap and not purely an a11y issue, it
      results in mobile keyboard/AT users being unable to navigate between
      Feed, Capability Map, and Problems. This is a functional gap that
      blocks WCAG 2.1.1 (Keyboard) for mobile contexts.
    auto_fixable: false
    fix_suggestion: >
      Either: (a) implement the mobile bottom nav as planned in V2, or
      (b) as an interim measure, render the sidebar as a collapsible drawer
      accessible via a hamburger button with aria-expanded state, rather than
      hiding it entirely. This is a product roadmap item, not a single-file fix.

      Minor gap noted in A11Y-007 (explicit aria-describedby association
      for external links). Overall structure is semantically sound.

  "1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics":
    status: PASS
    notes: >
      Relevance levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) use shape symbols (▲/■/▼) plus
      text labels — not color alone. Activity states (HOT/AKTIV/RUHIG) use
      icon (🔥/●/○) plus text labels — not color alone. Priority badges
      render text labels (Hoch/Mittel/Niedrig) with aria-label. Andrea
      persona requirement met. No red/green sole differentiator found.

  "1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)":
    status: FAIL
    notes: >
      --color-text-muted (#8b8fa8) on dark backgrounds (#1a1d27, #0f1117)
      produces approximately 3.1:1 contrast, failing the 4.5:1 AA requirement
      for small text. Affects feed card meta, capability tile descriptors,
      problem list count, problem card description. See A11Y-001 through
      A11Y-004. Root cause is a single CSS token — one fix resolves all.

  "2.1.1 Keyboard":
    status: PARTIAL_FAIL
    notes: >
      All interactive elements are natively keyboard accessible (buttons,
      links, form controls). Filter chips use <button> with aria-pressed.
      Critical gap: ProblemForm modal lacks focus trapping (A11Y-005).
      Input focus style removed in favor of box-shadow only (A11Y-008).
      Mobile navigation entirely absent (A11Y-013).

  "2.4.1 Bypass Blocks":
    status: PARTIAL_FAIL
    notes: >
      Root layout includes skip-link to #main-content — correct and visible
      on focus. Gap: no secondary skip link to bypass sidebar within the
      dashboard shell (A11Y-009). Keyboard users must Tab through sidebar
      nav on every page.

  "2.4.3 Focus Order":
    status: PARTIAL_FAIL
    notes: >
      DOM reading order matches visual order for primary content. Gap:
      capability detail panel does not receive focus when opened (A11Y-006).
      Modal dialog does not capture focus on open (covered by A11Y-005).

  "3.3.1 Error Identification":
    status: PASS_WITH_NOTES
    notes: >
      Errors are identified in text (not color alone), with role="alert"
      and aria-live="assertive" in ProblemForm. FeedList error banner uses
      role="alert". Minor robustness gap noted in A11Y-010 (conditionally
      rendered error element with aria-describedby reference).

  "4.1.2 Name, Role, Value":
    status: PASS_WITH_NOTES
    notes: >
      aria-label, aria-current, aria-pressed, aria-busy, aria-live,
      aria-modal, aria-labelledby, aria-required, aria-hidden all used
      appropriately throughout. Minor verbosity issue in CapabilityTile

  overall_assessment: >
    The KI-Radar frontend demonstrates strong accessibility intent: semantic
    HTML is consistently used, ARIA attributes are applied correctly in most
    cases, the skip link and live region are implemented, color is never the
    sole differentiator (Andrea persona requirement met), and the reduced-motion
    media query is present. These are non-trivial baseline investments that
    put the codebase ahead of most comparable products.

    The gate status is YELLOW (not RED) because all 4 HIGH violations trace
    to a single root cause: the --color-text-muted CSS token (#8b8fa8) does
    not meet 4.5:1 contrast on the dark backgrounds used. One token change
    fixes A11Y-001 through A11Y-004 simultaneously. No violations are CRITICAL.

    The 4 MEDIUM violations (modal focus trap, capability panel focus,
    external link association, input outline removal) are real usability
    blockers for keyboard and TTS users and should be resolved before the
    product reaches a wider user base. None block a current beta launch but
    all should be in the next sprint.

    Recommended actions before GREEN status:
      1. Fix --color-text-muted token → resolves A11Y-001, 002, 003, 004
      2. Implement focus trap in ProblemForm modal → resolves A11Y-005
      3. Add focus movement to CapabilityMap detail panel → resolves A11Y-006
      4. Fix aria-describedby on FeedCard external links → resolves A11Y-007
      5. Restore outline on .input:focus → resolves A11Y-008
      6. Add dashboard-level skip link → resolves A11Y-009

  gate_recommendation: >
